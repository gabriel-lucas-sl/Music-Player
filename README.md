    I am starting to learn javascript by myself, besides what I have been learning about this language programming in my university. 
    <br> <br>
    According to this, I decide start making some projects to improve my knowledges, which the one of them is my <strong><a href="https://gabriel-lucas-sl.github.io/Music-Player/">Music Player</a> Javascript Project</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>HTML </li>
    <li> CSS </li>
    <li> JAVASCRIPT </li>
</ul>
